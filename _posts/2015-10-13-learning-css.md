I believe authoring CSS is a lot different than programming. I also believe you can learn a lot from reading about the learnings of great programmers. Try on all the shoes. Throw away the ones that don't fit, and keep the ones that do. If you are looking for some things to read - I have a [reading list][0] that I keep updated with articles that have altered how I think about writing code.

## READ ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WRITE CODE THAT IS NOT CSS

All CSS for websites you have access to is open source by default. This is pretty rad for a few reasons. One being that you can unminify the code, read it, and learn a lot of things. There are also a lot of open source css projects written by people who spend a lot of time thinking about css.

## READ A LOT OF CODE

Learning doesn't happen by accident. Some people author css for years and don't get much better at it. It's not enough to just practice passively. I think practicing with intent is a much more efficient way to get better.

## THINK CRITICALLY

One of the best ways to learn how to not make mistakes is to make a ton of mistakes.

## WRITE A LOT OF CSS. MAKE A TON OF MISTAKES.

It doesn't need to be coffee, but talk to people! IF you work with people who write CSS, ask them what works for them. More importantly - ask them what doesn't work for them. Learning about peoples problems will help you solve problems better later on. Find css authors online that you respect and ask them to coffee, or if you aren't around them geographically - ask them questions over email. Maybe ask if they have time to do a video hangout over coffee. Some of the most impactful things I have learned have been because I met up with someone in real life and was privileged to ask them questions about their approach and just what they are up to. Asking [@dam][1] out for coffee one day was one of the most impactful things I did to push my own development knowledge forward. I also met a rad person that I enjoy talking to about life. Not everything is about code. CSS can just be a vessel for meeting rad people. But also respect people's privacy. Just because they contribute to open source projects doesn't mean they owe you their time. Don't be afraid to ask - but be respectful if you don't get a response.

## TALK TO PEOPLE

The web is largely text. People have been studying what makes things readable (as well as what gets in the way of readability) for hundreds of years. By learning the basics of typography - you'll have a better idea of how to use CSS to make interfaces easier to digest for your users.

## STUDY TYPOGRAPHY

CSS just modifies HTML. If you learn how HTML works by default - it will help you write better CSS. I learned HTML by reading the spec, and writing lots of unstyled HTML.

## LEARN HTML

There are a lot of different ways to get better at writing CSS. These are a few of the tips I've picked up that have helped me out along the way. Some of them might work, some of them might not.
